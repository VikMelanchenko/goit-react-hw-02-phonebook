Phonebook contacts storage application.
1/ The application consists of a form and a contact list.
Implemented:

- adding a contact name and displaying a contact list. The application does not save contacts between different sessions (page refresh).
- to generate identifiers, was used the shortid package.
- the search field is an input without a form. Its value is written to the state (controlled item).
- the filtering logic is case insensitive.
